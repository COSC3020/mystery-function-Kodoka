# Mystery Function

What does the `mystery()` function in the following piece of code do? Add your
answer to this markdown file.

```javascript
function mystery(a) {
    if(a.length == 1) return a[0];
    var foo = mystery(a.slice(1, a.length))
    if(foo > a[0]) return foo;
    else return a[0];
}
```

The function, mystery, takes in an array, a.

It then compares the length of the array, a, to 1. If the array is
of a length of 1, it returns the value stored at the 0th index of
the array, which is the only value in the array.

If the length of the array is not 1, we set a new variable, foo,
equal to the to the result of the mystery function, when given
a slice of the initial array, which is composed of the entirity
of the initial array, with the exception of the value stored at
the 0th index of the initial array.

It then returns the value of foo, if foo is greater than the value
at the 0th index of array a, or if foor is less than or equal to
the value at the 0th index of array a, it returns the value at the
0th index of the array a.

In summary, this is a recursive function that works through an
array of values to determine/return the greatest value.

Given the array
[5, 2, 3, 7] a quick summary of what would happen is:
a1.length > 1, foo1 = mystery([2, 3, 7])
a2.length > 1, foo2 = mystery([3, 7])
a3.length > 1, foo3 = mystery([7])
a4.length == 1, return 7, foo3 = 7
7 > 3, return 7, foo2 = 7
7 > 2, return 7, foo1 = 7
7 > 5, return 7

So 7 is the greatest value in the array.
